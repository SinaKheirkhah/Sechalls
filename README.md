## **About SecChalls** :mag:

SecChalls is an educational, introductory set of CTF-styled challenges which is aimed to encourage students, security researchers and also CTF players to get started with the field of **Web Application Security**.

## **Motivation** :dart:

The main goal of creating this repository was to provide a reliable platform where individuals can learn, practice and enhance their skills in the field of Web application security. As of the CTF-style, well, what better & interesting way to learn security than by playing CTFs?

I also believe these labs can be used by anyone to help others become good with the essentials and fundamentals of Web application security.
