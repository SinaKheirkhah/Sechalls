# Broken Authentication
Difficulty: 3/10

## Description
I've written a small cms containing around 50 users. 
Some of credentials have been leaked but I'm sure that the leakage doesn't affect other users.

"user": "yasho",
"pass": "fcea920f7412b5da7be0cf42b8c93759"

Please prove that he's wrong, become admin :)

## set-up
As simple as:
```
npm install
npm init
```
## Solution:
```
TODO
```
